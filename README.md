# Weather-JA

As A traveler wanting to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that you can plan a trip accordingly, look no further!
I created a weather dashboard with form inputs
when you search for a city then you are presented with current and future
conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
You will aslo be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation
of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
